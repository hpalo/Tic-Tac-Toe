# Tic-Tac-Toe
A repository for a Unity game project using editor version 6000.0.56f1 LTS.

Choose an AI player from two possibilities. The easier one chooses moves randomly. The harder one uses the Minimax algorithm and thus is imbossible to beat. At best, you can get a draw result.

You can try the game online:
